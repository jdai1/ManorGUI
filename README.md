# ManorGUI
Creating a GUI via PyQt5 for the backend calls of Swiss department store, Manor.

## Parameters
The purpose of this GUI application is to allow simple and comfortable interactions for the backend function calls of the Manor store. However, without having access to the Manor backend, extra parameters are neccesary to simulate real-time calls to the backend. In this GUI, four parameters are required as input for the function run:

1. IP Adress  
2. Port
3. Payload
4. Timer

While the IP Adress, Port, and Paylod are neccessary parameters to cary out regular calls to the backend, the Timer parameter simulates the specific time in which the function is to be completed.
